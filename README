== Instructions

This plugin is based on acts_as_taggable by DHH but includes extras
such as tests, smarter tag assignment, and tag cloud calculations.

Install
  * script/plugin install http://svn.viney.net.nz/things/rails/plugins/acts_as_taggable_on_steroids

== Usage

=== Basic tagging

Using the examples from the tests, let's suppose we have users that have many posts and we want those
posts to be able to be tagged by the user.

As usual, we add +acts_as_taggable+ to the Post class:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_taggable
    
    belongs_to :user
  end
  
We can now use the tagging methods provided by acts_as_taggable, <tt>tag_list</tt> and <tt>tag_list=</tt>. Both these
methods work like regular attribute accessors.

  p = Post.find(:first)
  p.tag_list # ""
  p.tag_list = "Funny, Silly"
  p.save
  p.reload.tag_list # "Funny, Silly"

=== Finding tagged objects

To retrieve objects tagged with a certain tag, use find_tagged_with.

  Post.find_tagged_with('Funny, Silly')
  
By default, find_tagged_with will find objects that have any of the given tags. To
find only objects that are tagged with all the given tags, use match_all.

  Post.find_tagged_with('Funny, Silly', :match_all => true)

=== Tag cloud calculations

To construct tag clouds, the frequency of each tag needs to be calculated.
Because we specified +acts_as_taggable+ on the <tt>Post</tt> class, we can
get a calculation of all the tag counts by using <tt>Post.tag_counts</tt>. But what if we wanted a tag count for
an single user's posts? To achieve this we call tag_counts on the association:

  User.find(:first).posts.tag_counts
  
  
Problems, comments, and suggestions all welcome. jonathan.viney@gmail.com

=== Other

If you want to change the delimiter used to parse tags, set Tag.delimiter.
For example, to use spaces instead of commas, add the following to config/environment.rb:

  Tag.delimiter = " "
